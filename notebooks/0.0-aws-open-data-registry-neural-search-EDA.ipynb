       "1  The [NOAA Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) Network (NCN)](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/CORS/), managed by NOAA/National Geodetic Survey ([NGS](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/)), provide Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, supporting three dimensional positioning, meteorology, space weather, and geophysical applications throughout the United States. The NCN is a multi-purpose, multi-agency cooperative endeavor, combining the efforts of hundreds of government, academic, and private organizations. The stations are independently owned and operated. Each agency shares their GNSS/GPS carrier phase and code range measurements and station metadata with NGS, which are analyzed and distributed free of charge.\\nNGS provides access to all NCN data collected since 9 February (040) 1994.\\n- #### Access to NCN Data and Products\\n    - [NOAA-NCN on AWS](https://noaa-cors-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\\n    - [NGS server: https://geodesy.noaa.gov/corsdata/](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/corsdata/)\\n    - [NGS's customized data request service (UFCORS)](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/UFCORS/)\\n    - [NGS Anonymous ftp://geodesy.noaa.gov/cors/ - This service is going away on August 02, 2021!](ftp://geodesy.noaa.gov/cors/)\\n- #### NCN Data and Products\\n    - **RINEX**: The GPS/GNSS data collected at NCN stations are made available to the public by NGS in Receiver INdependent EXchange (RINEX) format.

The 1940 census population schedules were digitized by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and released publicly on April 2, 2012.\\nThe 1940 Census enumeration district maps contain maps of counties, cities, and other minor civil divisions that show enumeration districts, census tracts, and related boundaries and numbers used for each census. The coverage is nation wide and includes territorial areas.\\nThe 1940 Census enumeration district descriptions contain written descriptions of census districts, subdivisions, and enumeration districts.\\n   \n",

This dataset provides two realizations of the 3DEP point cloud data. The first resource is a public access organization provided in [Entwine Point Tiles](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html) format, which a lossless, full-density, streamable octree based on [LASzip](https://laszip.org) (LAZ) encoding. The second resource is a [Requester Pays](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html) of the original, Raw LAZ (Compressed LAS) 1.4 3DEP format, and more complete in coverage, as sources with incomplete or missing CRS, will not have an ETP tile generated.  Resource names in both buckets correspond to the USGS project names.   \n",

The NCN is a multi-purpose, multi-agency cooperative endeavor, combining the efforts of hundreds of government, academic, and private organizations. The stations are independently owned and operated. Each agency shares their GNSS/GPS carrier phase and code range measurements and station metadata with NGS, which are analyzed and distributed free of charge.\\nNGS provides access to all NCN data collected since 9 February (040) 1994.\\n- #### Access to NCN Data and Products\\n    - [NOAA-NCN on AWS](https://noaa-cors-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\\n    - [NGS server: https://geodesy.noaa.gov/corsdata/](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/corsdata/)\\n    - [NGS's customized data request service (UFCORS)](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/UFCORS/)\\n    - [NGS Anonymous ftp://geodesy.noaa.gov/cors/ - This service is going away on August 02, 2021!](ftp://geodesy.noaa.gov/cors/)\\n- #### NCN Data and Products\\n    - **RINEX**: The GPS/GNSS data collected at NCN stations are made available to the public by NGS in Receiver INdependent EXchange (RINEX) format.
